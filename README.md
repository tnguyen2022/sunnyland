# Sunnyland
The Sunnyland Chemistry Website

This project uses [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [universal](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-universal-theme/)
theme to generate a static site from a mixture of markdown, yaml, and toml.

The repo is the source for the website stationed at https://web.northeastern.edu/sunnyland/

## Contributing

To contribute, clone this repo and commit any relevant changes.  You do not need to download hugo to work on this
website but it is recommended to do so to test that your changes work.  Currently all news updates require a change
to the site itself, and all new publications require a somewhat-automatic update as well, this is not ideal.  Moving
forward, it would be advantageous to allow trusted users to post news updates and publications without a developer's
approval.
