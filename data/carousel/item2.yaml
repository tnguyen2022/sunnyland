title: "Quorum Sensing Inhibition"
description: "Quorum sensing is a process by which bacteria sense cell density.  Shown here is the synthesis of two substrate analogues, S-anhydroribosyl-l-homocysteine and S-homoribosyl-l-cysteine, which prevent the initial and final step of the mechanism, respectively."
