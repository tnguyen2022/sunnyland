description: 'Abstract The frequent coisolation of bacteria with Phytophthora and Pythium species suggests possible interspecies communication. Zoospore-free fluids (ZFF) from bacteria-free and nutrient-depleted zoospore suspensions were examined to investigate the production of autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a bacterial interspecies signal molecule, by zoosporic oomycetes. ZFF from Phytophthora nicotianae, Phytophthora sojae, and Pythium aphanidermatum triggered luminescence of the Vibrio harve7yi AI-2 reporter, indicating the presence of AI-2 in zoospore extracellular products and the potential of cross-kingdom communication between oomycetes and bacteria. The production of AI-2 by zoospores was confirmed by chemical assays. These results provide a new insight into the physiology and ecology of oomycetes.'
