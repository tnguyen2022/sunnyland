description: 'Abstract A single-step convenient synthesis of l-selenohomocysteine (SeHcy) from l-selenomethionine (SeMet) using sodium in liquid ammonia is described. Methionine synthases convert SeHcy to SeMet at rates comparable to their rates of conversion of l-homocysteine (Hcy) to l-methionine (Met). This study suggests that SeHcy generated from SeMet metabolism can be efficiently recycled to SeMet in mammals.'
